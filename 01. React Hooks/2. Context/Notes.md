# Context API

- a feature that allows you to manage and share state across your component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level (PROP DRILLING).

- Useful for scenarions where you need to share data or functions across many components especially when those components are deeply nested

# useContext Hook
- Allows us to access the context values provided by a context object directly within a functional component
